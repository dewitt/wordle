- [x] Update PLAN.md / TODO.md (current file).
- [x] Document binary format & generator workflow in DESIGN.md.
- [x] Update PLAN.md / TODO.md (current file).
- [x] Rename CLI binary to `solver`.
- [x] Introduce explicit modes (`solve`, `start`, `generate`, `help`) and shared flag parsing.
- [x] Combine verbose/debug logging under one `--debug`.
- [x] Update docs/scripts (README, benchmark) for new CLI.
- [x] Regenerate lookup table via new CLI, re-run benchmarks/tests.
- [x] Document `feedback_table.bin` format in DESIGN.md.
- [ ] Ensure formatting & tidy repo; commit.
- [x] Retire PLAN.md workflow (use TODO.md as the single source of task tracking).
- [x] Restructure codebase: keep CLI entry minimal in `solver_main.cpp`.
- [x] Extract runtime traversal (loading lookup, solving) into `solver_runtime.{h,cpp}`.
- [x] Extract lookup generator (state bitsets, memoization, serialization) into `lookup_generator.{h,cpp}`.
- [x] Extract shared word/feedback utilities into dedicated modules (e.g., `words_data`, `feedback_cache`).
- [x] Update CMakeLists.txt for new source files.
- [x] Adjust docs (README/DESIGN) to reflect new source layout.
- [x] Rebuild, run solver tests/benchmark, ensure functionality unchanged (basic smoke tests).
- [ ] Implement new lookup generator:
  - [x] Add state bitset type and memoization cache keyed by remaining subsets.
  - [x] Introduce tunable lookahead depth and scoring heuristic (max subset, total size, letter-weight tie breaker).
  - [ ] Enforce depth ≤ 6 with backtracking when branches overflow.
  - [ ] Emit sparse nodes from the in-memory tree into the existing binary format.
- [ ] Thread new generator into CLI (`generate` mode) with appropriate flags.
- [ ] Add validation/regression tests proving every word in `words.txt` resolves ≤ 6 turns.
- [ ] Update DESIGN.md/README.md with finalized generator details once implementation stabilizes.
